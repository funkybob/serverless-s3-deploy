# serverless-s3-deploy

Plugin for serverless to deploy files to a variety of S3 Buckets

# Usage

Add to your serverless.yml:

```
  plugins:
    - serverless-s3-deploy

  custom:
    assets:
      targets:
       - bucket: my-bucket
         files:
          - source: ../assets/
            globs: '**/*.css'
          - source: ../app/
            empty: true
            globs:
              - '**/*.js'
              - '**/*.map'
       - bucket: my-other-bucket
         prefix: /subdir'
         files:
          - source: ../email-templates/
            globs: '**/*.html'
```

You can specify any number of `target`s that you want. Each `target` has a
`bucket` and a `prefix`.

`bucket` is either the name of your S3 bucket or a reference to a
CloudFormation resources created in the same serverless configuration file.
See below for additional details.

You can specify `source` relative to the current directory.

Each `source` has its own list of `globs`, which can be either a single glob,
or a list of globs.

Setting `empty` to `true` will delete all files inside the bucket. The prefix
value is respected and files outside will not be deleted.

Now you can upload all of these assets to your bucket by running:

```
$ sls s3deploy
```

If you have defined multiple buckets, you can limit your deployment to
a single bucket with the `--bucket` option:

```
$ sls s3deploy --bucket my-bucket
```

## ACL

You can optionally specificy an ACL for the files uploaded on a per target
basis:

```
  custom:
    assets:
      targets:
        - bucket: my-bucket
          acl: private
          files:
```

The default value is `public-read`. Options are defined
[here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl).

## Content Type

The appropriate Content Type for each file will attempt to be determined using
``mime-types``. If one can't be determined, a default fallback of
'application/octet-stream' will be used.

You can override this fallback per-source by setting ``defaultContentType``.

```
  custom:
    assets:
      targets:
        - bucket: my-bucket
          files:
            - source: html/
              defaultContentType: text/html
              ...
```

## Other Headers

Additional headers can be included per target by providing a ``headers`` object.

See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html for more
details.

```
  custom:
    assets:
      targets:
        - bucket: my-bucket
          files:
            - source: html/
              headers:
                CacheControl: max-age=31104000 # 1 year
```

## Resolving References

A common use case is to create the S3 buckets in the `resources` section of
your serverless configuration and then reference it in your S3 plugin
settings:

```
  custom:
    assets:
      targets:
        - bucket:
            Ref: MyBucket
          files:
            - source: html/

  resources:
    # AWS CloudFormation Template
    Resources:
      MyBucket:
        Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
        Properties:
          AccessControl: PublicRead
          WebsiteConfiguration:
            IndexDocument: index.html
            ErrorDocument: index.html
```

## Auto-deploy

If you want s3deploy to run automatically after a deploy, set the `auto` flag:

```
  custom:
    assets:
      auto: true
```

## IAM Configuration

You're going to need an IAM policy that supports this deployment. This might be
a good starting point:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket}"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket}/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
